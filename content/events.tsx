        While I was always a tinkerer, even far before I got into programming,
        as one of my best friends moved to my city and started a engineering
        major, we've been working on far more ambitious projects before. It's
        definitely my second passion, and a good balance for my screen time
        haha.

        After a long time waiting, I finally splurged on a 3D printer. I love
        the flexibility of being able to create almost anything in a few hours
        and enjoy using all of the different materials.
